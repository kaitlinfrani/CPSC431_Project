# CPSC431_Project

## Project Description

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly scheduling platform specifically designed to facilitate streamlined coordination between medical offices and their respective clients, predominantly doctors looking to expand their practices.

This innovative platform will provide a comprehensive solution for making appointments, enabling smoother interaction and efficient time management for both parties. As the primary users, medical offices will host the platform, creating an interactive digital environment where clients can conveniently schedule their appointments with healthcare providers.
